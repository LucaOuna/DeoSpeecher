## Introduction
This project consists of speech recognition on Raspberry Pi. It performs a speech to text conversion as well as following voice controlled actions:
- Activate a deodorant
- Repeat sentences from microphone signal (speech to text then text to speech)
- Shut down the running program with the command "stop"

## Demonstration

## Requirements
Once you have a Raspberry Pi with Python3 installed, you have to add some libraries for performing the project:
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
```Shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
That allows libraries installation with "pip" command
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
```Shell
sudo pip install speechrecognition
```
That is the main library to convert speech to text
- [PyAudio](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/)
```Shell
sudo pip install pyaudio
```
That is python audio I/O library
- [Pyttsx](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx/)
```Shell
sudo pip install pyttsx
```
That contains "eSpeak" module to convert text to audio
- [Subprocess](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html) (already installed in official python versions)
```Shell
sudo pip install subprocess
```
That contains the "call" function allowing to save text into audio wav file thanks to "eSpeak" module

## Hardware
There are different devices to connect on the Raspberry Pi:
- Microphone on input port of USB sound card
- Speakers on output port of USB sound card
- Button on GPIO 18
- Servo motor on GPIO 22 (control wire)
- Green LED on GPIO 20
- Red LED on GPIO 21
Reproduce the following circuit:

## Software
The first step is to configure microphone and speaker with "alsamixer" module:
```Shell
   apt-get install libasound2 alsa-utils alsa-oss
   alsamixer
```
Then, we can run the main code "DeoSpeecher.py":
```Shell
   cd folder_of_main_code
   python DeoSpeecher.py
```
Finally, configure your Raspberry Pi to launch the code directly when you turn it on. For that, edit the file rc.local:
```Shell
   sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
And add these 2 lines just before "exit" instruction:
```Shell
   cd folder_of_main_code
   python DeoSpeecher.py
```
That's it ! Henceforth, you can play with your new speech recognizer.
